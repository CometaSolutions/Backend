# Backend
The backend-part (both general and HTTP-specific) for systems with backend-frontend architecture

Currently a bit of WIP, but a sample with documentation is available [here](./Source/Sample).

TODO overhaul sample from nuget-based to more dev-based example (which is probably more common usecase for webdev).
